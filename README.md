# Kafka Streams Samples

Better read in [book format.](https://jbcodeforce.github.io/kafka-streams-samples/).

## Projects

All the examples are modelized as unit tests. So `mvn test` will run all of them.

### Getting started

It is under the `kstreams-getting-started` folder.

### Stateful stream examples

Stateful operations using KTable samples are under the `kstreams-stateful` folder.
